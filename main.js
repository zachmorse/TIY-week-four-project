/*
  Here is a guide for the steps you could take:
*/

// 1. First select and store the elements you'll be working with

// 2. Create your `onSubmit` event for getting the user's search term

// 3. Create your `fetch` request that is called after a submission

axios.get(
  "https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks?client_id=095fe1dcd09eb3d0e1d3d89c76f5618f"
);

// 4. Create a way to append the fetch results to your page

// 5. Create a way to listen for a click that will play the song in the audio play
